                Why this picture? Some of the most memorable memories I had where when I was a kid. I was around the age of 5-6 when I got this picture taken, it was after my birthday party. 
                I was really energetic during this time, around this time was when I got my first tricycle. I was a troublemaker when I was younger! Everytime I was on the verge of trouble 
                either getting hit by my mother or father I would hop on my tricycle and dip! I met a lot of friends during this time, although I moved so often I didn't get to keep in contact 
                with the friends I had made. Moving often was hard but at the same time it was a good exprience for me meeting a lot of new people.

        Boxing was always a sport I was interested in, I usually sat down to watch it on the TV with my dad.
        I heard about a boxing gym that my friends and my cousin liked, I thought about it for a while and during
        the end of freshmen year I signed up for it. I got really into it because of the environment and the people.
        I stopped boxing after two years around summer before coming into senior year, I gave up on it because 
        all the people I competed with and trained with stopped coming, although I took a break I'm planning on making a come back!

            I put a picture of tokyo becuase I've always wanted to travel, and why not there? I love sushi and ramen and want to see what the originals taste like!
